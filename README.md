# ColourSensorPrototype
A colour sensor created using an Arduino, a light-dependent resistor, and an RGB LED.

Our eyes recognise different colours from the frequency of the light reflected from the object. By recording the amount of light from different wavelengths that is either absorbed or reflected with an LDR, we can imitate this process.

You will need:
- 2x 220 ohms resistor
- m/m jumper wires
- Cathode RGB LED
- Light-dependent resistor
- Breadboard
- Arduino
